# react-tutorial

Following [the Facebook React tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) but to make it harder for no good reason I'm also using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html).

I've never used webpack in my life.
